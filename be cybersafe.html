            <h2>Prevent Cyberbullying</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Use in-app privacy tools and settings</span><br>In
                    todays world, almost all social media apps have the option to make your account private, or not
                    <br>allow strangers to send you direct messages. You can make use of this and stop cyberbullying<br>
                    before it can even happen to you.</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Keep personal information private</span><br> Before
                    posting, or sharing something, make sure you don’t share your address, the places you<br> visit
                    normally such as school, or a cafe you visit pretty often, or even your last name. addresses<br> can
                    make it pretty easy for cyberbullies to target you and start stalking you in real life.</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Think before posting/commenting </span><br>Posting
                    impulsive posts is an open door for cyberbullies to walk in from. Even if you post something<br> and
                    delete it immediately, there’s still the risk that someone took a screenshot from it, and shared it
                    <br>with others. It’s always best to double check and think about what you are going to post or
                    comment.</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Try to limit your posts and screen-time on social
                        media</span><br>You can easily attract the attention of cyberbullies if you're one of those
                    people who post a lot of<br> pictures and selfies. The pictures and everyday routines that you post
                    gives them a lot of material to <br>start their work with.</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Log out from your account in public
                        devices</span><br>if you are using a public computer, and you’re logged into your social media
                    account through the<br> public device, make sure to log out of your account before leaving. Delete
                    your password from the <br>web browser after you are done with it. Simply closing the site is not
                    enough. Cyberbullies can easily<br> walk up to the device you were using, see your account, change
                    your password and start impersonating <br>you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Already a Victim?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Report</span><br>Most social platforms have the
                    option to report an offensive/harmful post or message. If you are getting <br>cyberbullied publicly,
                    this is one of the things you must do. Report the post that is about you. Tell your <br>friends to
                    also report the post. This way they will remove the post from their platforms and give a warning
                    <br>to the bully.</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Block</span><br>If you are getting cyberbullied via
                    private chat, then the best option is to quickly report and block them. By<br> doing this, they will
                    receive a warning/get their account suspended, and no longer will be able to send you <br>messages.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Do Not Respond</span><br>Simply ignore them. Do not
                    respond to anything they say. You can even log out for some time. Cyberbullies<br> mostly want to
                    see the reaction of their victim. They want to drive a response out of their targets. When you<br>
                    show no reaction and ignore them, they get bored and stop targeting you</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Save Evidence</span><br>Save all the conversations
                    between yourself and the cyberbully. Screenshot any harmful or offensive posts<br> and whatever they
                    tell you in private chat. This will come in handy whenever you asked for help from a trusted
                    <br>adult. </li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500;">Tell a Trusted Adult</span><br>You should not
                    hesitate to talk about this with a trusted adult or your close friends. Friends can support you
                    <br>emotionally and trusted adults such as parents or teachers can give you advice on how to face
                    the situation.<br> Show any evidence you have from the cyberbullying posts or messages to them.</li>
